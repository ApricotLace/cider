= Using shadow-cljs

Provided you've configured your project correctly, you can simply use
`cider-jack-in-cljs` for `shadow-cljs`.

This will automatically start the shadow-cljs server and connect to
it. You'll also be prompted for the build to use.

Alternatively you can start the server manually with something like:

[source,sh]
----
$ npx shadow-cljs server
----

And connect to it with `cider-connect`.

If you already have a running server watching a build (for instance
you have already run `npx shadow-cljs watch :dev`), you can use the
`shadow-select` CLJS REPL and specify `:dev` when prompted.
