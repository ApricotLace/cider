= Babashka

Babashka is highly compatible with Clojure, so it works with CIDER out of the box. All you need to do
is start its bundled nREPL server:

  $ bb --nrepl-server

And connect to it afterwards using kbd:[C-c C-x c j] (`cider-connect-clj`).

Babashka's nREPL server supports all core nREPL operations, plus code completion, so you'll get all of
CIDER's basic functionality with it.

NOTE: Depending on your CIDER version you might get some warnings about missing Clojure/nREPL versions. You can safely
ignore those.

Currently you can't use `cider-jack-in` with Babashka, but this may change down the road.
