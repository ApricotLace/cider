= Scittle, Nbb, Joyride, and future (n)REPLs

== The Problem

CIDER was created in the early days of Clojure where there weren't any
of the alternative implementation that exist today. This lead to a design
that relied on knowledge of certain specifics of Clojure internal and
the Clojure nREPL server.

Later, with the introduction of ClojureScript we made another set
of assumptions, related to the way hosted ClojureScript works. (e.g. that
you start with an ordinary Clojure REPL that gets "upgraded" to a
ClojureScript REPL by the invocation of a special form)

Lately we've been working to address this and
make CIDER more runtime-agnostic.

== The Solution

As of CIDER 1.3, the default CIDER connection command `cider-connect-clj` is
capable of connecting to any nREPL server that provides minimal required
functionality.

As such, all of these work:
https://github.com/babashka/nbb[nbb],
https://github.com/babashka/scittle[scittle], https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/joyride[joyride]

First start an nREPL server (the project's Readme usually has a section
on starting a nREPL server).

You can use

kbd:[M-x `cider-connect-clj` <RET>]

to connect to any Clojure(Script) nREPL server.

Features:

* Eval, load file etc.
* Errors as overlays. (The default cider error buffer is not implemented currently).
* Other nREPL features the server provides; This might be rather minimal.

Nbb, Scittle and Joyride all have quite cool completions already.

NOTE: For nbb you can alternatively connect via cljs, see xref:platform/nbb.adoc[Nbb]
