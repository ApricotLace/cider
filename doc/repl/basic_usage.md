# Basic Usage

CIDER comes with a powerful REPL that complements the interactive
development functionality in `cider-mode`. Using the CIDER REPL you
can experiment with your running program, test functions, or just
explore a new library you're interested in using. The CIDER REPL offers a number of advanced features:

* auto-completion
* font-locking (the same as in `clojure-mode`)
* quick access to many CIDER commands (e.g. definition and documentation lookup, tracing, etc)
* (optional) pretty-printing of evaluation results
* eldoc support
* highly customizable REPL prompt
